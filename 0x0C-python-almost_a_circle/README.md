# 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle


This project is a combination of all the concepts that I have learnt in python so far. I'm doing it in preparation for the AirBnB project which is a very big part of Higher Level Programming section of the Holberton Software Engineering curriculum. It covers:

Import

Exceptions
Class
Private attribute
Getter/Setter
br
Class method
Static method
Inheritance
Unittest
Read/Write file
args and kwargs
Serialization/Deserialization
JSON
